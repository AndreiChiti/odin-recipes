<p>In this project I built a basic recipe website.</p>
<p>This project consist of a main page with links to a few recipes.</p>
<p>In this project I used the following tags:</p>
<ul>
<li>a to link my recipes with a relative link and to credit the recipe makers with an absolute link.</li>
<li>img to put images with the recipes using src to link the image adress, alt to add a description to images and height to resize immages.</li>
<li>h to put headings </li>
<li> ul to make unorganized lists and ol to make organized lists.</li>
	</ul>
